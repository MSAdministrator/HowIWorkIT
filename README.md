# What is this?

This is a series of articles based on the LifeHacker series "How I work". http://lifehacker.com/tag/how-i-work. It's mean to give readers a glimpse into your work lifestyle, how you work and how you get things done. I thought it'd be cool to do an IT-specific one to give people a glimpse at bloggers, SMEs, MVPs...work lives and what they do on a daily basis.

## How do I participate?

Write a blog post on your blog answering all of the questions below and be sure to [include a link to the "This is How I Work" participants page](https://github.com/adbertram/HowIWorkIT/blob/master/ThisIsHowIWork.md). Once your article is complete and is live, either [open an issue here](https://github.com/adbertram/HowIWorkIT/issues/new) or submit a PR (if you know how to do that) to get your link added. I will be keeping a list of all participating bloggers here.

- Where are you located?
- What is/are your current gig(s):
- What's one word to describe your work?
- What apps, software, or tools can’t you live without?
- What does your workspace look like? (Take a picture if you can)
- What's a typical workweek look like? 
- What do you like the best about your role?
- What's something about you that no one knows about?
- What do you listen to while you work?
- What do you wish you could change about your work?
- Is there anything else you’d like to add that might be interesting to readers?

There's no set time to post these kinds of post. I'm just going to be posting mine on 11/23/16. It'd be nice if anyone participating could post that same week or the next.
